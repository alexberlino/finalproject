            <h2 id="description">Company Description</h2>
            The company follows a platform approach, offering Fashion and Lifestyle products to customers in 17 European markets. Zalando with its now 3 co-CEOs, was founded by Rocket internet, it now makes over 5.3 billion in revenues. With over
            15k employees, it is the giant of Berlin's start up success stories. <br><br>
            <span class="bold">Founded: 2008</span> <br>
            <h2 id="summary"> Executive Summary</h2>
            Zalando gets a lot of traffic thanks to brands, to its own mostly ("Zalando" has a search volume of 4m - as a comparison "nike" has a search volume of less than half a million), and all the most famous fashion brands it has in its stock.
            Zalando ranks regularly in the top 5 for clothing brands.<br><br>
            Surprisingly its mobile performance is quite average with issues with Javascript with big payloads, and not very efficient cache policy. Although Zalando has a huge amount of backlinks pointing to its site, for strong backlinks, it relies
            mostly on its own sites.
