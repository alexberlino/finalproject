                        <h2 class="title is-4 is-heavy">Content marketing to share your expertise and build your brand</h2>

                        <p>In fact, classical link building outreach should reserved to small or new websites and brands who need to make a name for themselves. Think of Heineken's founder who when the beer was not yet the brand it is,
                            allegedly went from bar to bar to ask for Heineken and would storm out when the bar didn't have it in offer "I will come to this bar only when you will serve Heineken". Same goes to small and new websites which
                            still need to make a name for themselves. It is time-consuming, costly and not that enjoyable but necessary to get that minimum domain authority and visibility.</p>

                        <p>As the website grows in popularity for the recognised product or service you offer, links should come to you through brand building, it becomes more a PR work. Same for Heineken when the beer started winning prizes,
                            no more need to go from bar to bar to get the brand that visibility.</p>


                        <p>Google constantly evolves with technology, integrating new factors for rankings and aiming for "offline" signals in part about brand trust. Meaning more established companies should mostly focus on brand building in
                            different ways than buying or begging for links. Go for the 3Ts: Trust, Traffic and Topics. Trusted sites with great topic content get traffic.</p>

                        <p>Whether established or not, you want positive signals and interactions for your brand with Brand mentions keeping away from directly promoting your product or service but building brand awareness and trust, by
                            sharing content or data which are of interest for your target, with topics they care about, or trending news topics. But more established companies should definitely be focusing more on content marketing than
                            backlink outreach.</p>
