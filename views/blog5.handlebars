        <h1 class="h1services"> Voice Search and how it challenges SEO
        </h1>
        <div>
            Once you are ready for mobile first, the next step is to prepare your website for Voice Search.<br><br>


            Facts:<br>
            <br>

            People are more and more equipped with Voice Search devices and use them, in fact 40% of adults perform a voice search at least once a day.<br>

            Voice searches are not formulated the same way as when one searches when typing.<br>

            Google Voice Search accuracy is now 95% accurate versus below 80% 5 years ago.<br>

            20% of mobile queries are voice searches and this figure is rising expected to reach 50% by 2020.<br><br>


            <h3>Voice Search devices and technology:</h3><br><br>


            Google Assistant<br>

            Google Home<br>

            Amazon Alexa<br>

            Echo<br>

            Microsoft Cortana<br>

            <br><br>

            <h3>How are voice search queries different to text searches?</h3>
            <br><br><br>


            They are more conversational therefore they are longer queries with question words (how, why, who, where, what).<br><br>



            A useful tool to find questions asked for a specific them is Answerthepublic.<br><br>

            Finally a lot of these queries are Local, another good reason to integrate Local SEO in your SEO strategy.<br><br>



            <h3>Featured Snippets (or Answer Box) </h3><br><br>


            Google mostly uses Featured Snippets to answer voice queries. These are in most cases Paragraphs. but they can also be Lists and Tables.<br><br>



            15% of all queries come up Featured Snippets<br><br>



            To get your site as a featured snippet does not require you to rank #1 in organic search but in most cases you need to be on the first page already..<br><br>



            Also there is no schema Featured Snippet but a page in your website needs to the target search term in the correct format. There is an interesting article on Moz about how to optimize for Featured Snippets<br><br>


            <h3>What else to do:</h3><br>

            <br>

            On top of trying to feature in Featured Snippets for the searches which matter aim to optimize for long tail terms, using a conversational tone. <br><br>


            Adding an FAQ section which includes the important questions will also help.<br><br>



            Finally, if this is not yet done optimize your google MyBusiness profile for better visibility for Local SEO as many searches are local ("near me")
