                        <h3>Facts:</h3>

                        People are more and more equipped with Voice Search devices and use them, in fact 40% of adults perform a voice search at least once a day.<br>

                        Voice searches are not formulated the same way as when one searches when typing.<br>

                        Google Voice Search accuracy is now 95% accurate versus below 80% 5 years ago.<br>

                        20% of mobile queries are voice searches and this figure is rising expected to reach 50% by 2020.<br><br>

                        </p>

                        <h3>Voice Search devices and technology:</h3>


                        Google Assistant<br>

                        Google Home<br>

                        Amazon Alexa<br>

                        Echo<br>

                        Microsoft Cortana<br>

                        <br><br>

                        <h3>How are voice search queries different to text searches?</h3>


                        They are more conversational therefore they are longer queries with question words (how, why, who, where, what).<br><br>



                        A useful tool to find questions asked for a specific them is Answerthepublic.<br><br>

                        Finally a lot of these queries are Local, another good reason to integrate Local SEO in your SEO strategy.<br><br>



                        <h3>Featured Snippets (or Answer Box) </h3>
                        Google mostly uses Featured Snippets to answer voice queries. These are in most cases Paragraphs. but they can also be Lists and Tables.<br><br>



                        15% of all queries come up Featured Snippets<br><br> To get your site as a featured snippet does not require you to rank #1 in organic search but in most cases you need to be on the first page already..<br><br>



                        Also there is no schema Featured Snippet but a page in your website needs to the target search term in the correct format. There is an interesting article on Moz about how to optimize for Featured Snippets<br><br>


                        <h3>What else to do:</h3>


                        On top of trying to feature in Featured Snippets for the searches which matter aim to optimize for long tail terms, using a conversational tone. <br><br>


                        Adding an FAQ section which includes the important questions will also help.<br><br>



                        Finally, if this is not yet done optimize your google MyBusiness profile for better visibility for Local SEO as many searches are local ("near me")
