            <i>For all countries: it is preferable to have a localised domain, hosted in target country, localised content adapted to target. Need to register and control traffic using respective Webmaster tools & local web services from dominating
                Search engines.<br><br>

                China: Google has a tiny Market share (except in Hong Kong) : rather Baidu and Sogou. Importance of Baidu’s own products: (Baike, Zhidao, Tieba, etc.). Sogou emergence backed by Tencent’s WeChat (1 billion users) and taking advantage
                of Baidu’s loss of dominance since a scandal.<br><br>

                Japan: Although Google now dominates the market, Yahoo! which is more than a Search engine is still key. They offer many other services: News, Shopping, Finance, Map, Bookstore, Mail, Car navigation, Train navigation, Dating, Credit
                card, Mobile networks, Hotel booking, Auction, Advertising. Big contrast versus Google’s initial empty search page. Highly supported by main shareholder Softbank.<br><br>

                South Korea: Naver is similar to Yahoo! Japan in a market also dominated by Google. Naver shows bias towards its own assets: Naver Encyclopaedia, Knowledge IN, Naver Blog, Naver Café) and paid advertisements.

            <img src="/baidu.png" class="searchconsole" />
            <br><br><br>

            Webmaster Tools for Baidu in Chinese, important to set up to register account and verify the website. Also Needed: an Internet Content Publishing (ICP) license.
            Very few non-Chinese website show: importance of Chinese tld, hosting provider (HK or Mainland China) and physical address
            Black hat much more successful than on Google (although still should be avoided)
            Baidu Doesn’t Support Schema.org
            Many ads on first page
            Direct competition with Baidu’s own products (Baike, Zhidao, Tieba, etc.). Importance of creating company profile on Baike, engaging Q&A platform on Zhidao (Chinese Quora), and leverage file sharing platform Wenku
            Baidu suffered a big scandal (Wei Zexi scandal) and since then its reputation and market domination is more fragile

            <h3>About Sogou</h3><br>
            <img src="/sogou.png" class="searchconsole" />
            <br><br><br>
            It has its own unique algorithm meaning that strategies designed for Baidu won’t be as effective on Sogou.
            Acquired by Tencent (WeChat*), one of the largest tech companies in China. No other search engine in China is capable of searching on WeChat. With over 1 billion users on WeChat this gives Sogou a serious leg up over its competitors.

            <h2 class="h1hp">Japan</h2>

            The Japanese have an affinity for local brands, and it is important to be as local as possible.
            In the Japanese languages, there are many different ways to write the same thing. It is important to know what’s most preferred by the target audience. Each term will result in different site rankings.
            Like for China and Korea: hosting locally within Japan, with a local IP address, can yield better organic search rankings.
            Japanese users consider clean web design to be desolate.
