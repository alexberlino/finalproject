<h2>Personalised Strategies</h2>



-Site & brand Maturity (basic links vs content marketing)<br>

-Industry<br>

-Company Business priorities<br>

-SEO priority (type of page, site section, etc)<br>

 <br>

Relationship with clients and prospects needs to stay personalised. Reasons more not to automate link building or scale it up to uncontrollable level. <br>


<br><br>


<h2>Sending Positive Signals</h2>



One of the goals of back linking & link acquisition through content marketing is to send positive signals and interactions with the brand. <br><br>

Brand mentions should often keep away from directly promoting the product /service whilst building brand awareness & trust by sharing content or data which are of interest for your target, with topics they care about, or trending news topics<br>





<h2>Research to find prospects</h2>





Less is more: Limit targeting: find best matches for high CVR instead of aiming for more accepting low CVR<br><br>




Focus on Content relevance & Site Quality<br>




Target in priority influencers & Media outlets<br>







<h2>Influencers to amplify reach</h2>



Influencers: bloggers, journalists, authors, podcasters, conferences organiser, researchers or editors.
<br>


They often use Twitter so it is important to get to understand Twitter and use this channel if you want to get in touch and better know them.


<br>
Influencer targeted: high DA (Domain Authority) sites, specific keywords terms, other sites in sector or niche<br><br><br>





<h2>PR and SEO are one</h2>



Effective link building requires outreach, and that requires you to truly understand what motivates people<br><br>

You have to introduce yourself, frame your pitch and demonstrate how youâ€™ll make their job easier all in a couple of hundred words.<br><br>

PR & Brand team  from company are also important for SEO with press releases, company reputation, values etc<br>
