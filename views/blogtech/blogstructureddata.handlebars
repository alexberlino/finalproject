                            improve the way your pages are
                            displayed.</span><br><br>




                        <h2 class="title is-4 is-black is-heavy">What are Structured Data for</h2>

                        You can use Structured Data to provide additional information about creative work, events, organisation, a person, a place or a product. <br>Here is a list of the most common used of Structured Data:<br><br>
                        * Organization information<br>
                        * Local business Markup<br>
                        * Product and Offer<br>
                        * Breadcrumb<br>
                        * Ratings<br>
                        * Site navigation<br><br>


                        The recommended format is JSON-LD but you can also use Microdata an RDFa, not microformats.<br><br>



                        <h2 class="title is-4 is-black is-heavy">Tips</h2>
                        * Make sure the content you are promoting is your content or your users'<br>
                        * Don't mark hidden, misleading or irrelevant content<br>
                        * Don't mix up Structured Data with Open Graph, which is used by Facebook. Although a type of markup, it is not as detailed.<br>
                        * Implementing Structured Data doesn't guaranty it will be shown as you wish on the SERPs..<br>
                        * When displayed correctly and with visibility, they will boost your CTR<br><br>


                        Rankings: There is no proof that using Structured Data currently improves your rankings. However, this will certainly change with mobile first, voice search and how Google's indexation is heading to closer dependance on API,
                        XML and JSON-LD feeds.
