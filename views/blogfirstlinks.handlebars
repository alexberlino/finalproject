                        <h2 class="title is-3">Some tips for those first links to get started:</h2>

                        <p>First and for all, make sure your website is ready and optimized before you start getting the attention.<br /> Associate the website with the owner or key figures of the company</p>

                        <p>Search for mentions of competitors whether lists, directories and comparison and get your name there</p>

                        <p>Search for list or directories of local organisations in your area of operation or with the same attributes. Also local chamber of commerce, newspaper, sport club offering a discount...)</p>

                        <p>Guest post on popular and relevant blogs, build relationships with influencers. Check for dead links</p>

                        <p>Get reviews from online influencers, or independent review sites such as G2Crowd</p>

                        <p>Monitor non linked mentions of the website and get them made as links. This however should not be too much of a priority as there are more signals which are pointing to the fact these mentions are already considered b
                            Google as trust ones</p>

                        <p>Useful tools for this research: Majestic SEO and Open Site Explorer (Moz). SEMRush to identify the top ranking pages on a site</p>

                        <h2 class="title is-3">Competitive link mining</h2>

                        <p>It should be partially used to figure out a few choice bits to add to your own strategy, not a massive pattern to copy. For instance:</p>

                        <span class="blue-dot-list">
                            <ul>
                                <li>a quality directories where you donâ€™t yet have a listing.</li>
                                <li>authoritative sites that you can possibly start writing for.</li>
                                <li>finding resource pages where you could add a link to your site.</li>
                                <li>these should not be link methods to use extensively. Better to find new links.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </span>

                        <h2 class="title is-3">Quality User-generated Forum Link Building</h2>

                        <p>Mostly to drive traffic and for <a href="/en/blog/seo-glossary#brandbuilding">brand awareness</a> as links are normally <a href="/en/blog/seo-glossary#nofollow">nofollow</a>. Do create content for forum and point it, participating in
                            relevant
                            other conversations to avoid focusing only self-promotion.</p>

                        <h2 class="title is-3">Measuring, Controlling and Learning</h2>

                        <p>Track visitors, conversions and traffic. Compare Keywords rankings</p>
                        <p>Evaluate how any improvements in ranking improves or not your goals for conversion, maybe the ones you are targeting are not the best ones.</p>
