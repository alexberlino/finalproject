SEO is important for getting high quality visitors from search which are searching what the website has to offer. Given how the algorithms have evolved these last years, there is also much focus on user-friendliness of the website to increase its credibility and respect from search engines such as Google, Bing and Yandex. Search engines use more and more complex algorithms to determine which pages to include in their index and the order they show these pages in the search results. SEO is the way to ‘speak’ to search engines in a language they can understand and give them as much information about your website as possible.",
